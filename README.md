## Introduction

Healthy website is a social media platform for healthy cooking recipes. Users are able to share their own healthy recipes with others. This social platform targets users who are interested in healthy cooking recipes. Each user has the ability to share a post with a recipe title, ingredients and recipe directions so others can apply it easily. Users are given the ability also to like, leave comments and bookmarks others recipes.

The fully deployed project can be accessed at [Here](https://pp4-yummy-d1fe3ffd7115.herokuapp.com/)

### Design

#### Colours
* The colour scheme was used in the project based on blue color and its shades.White color for main background for each div component, light blue for the main background, dark blue for nav links and headers. It is a great light shade and suitable for the text in which for creating a good contrast.

## Agile Methodology
The project was developed using the Agile methodology. Product backlog is detailed into three levels:<br>
* Epics which is a large quantities of related work, which were five epics for the project. Each of them has a list of features.
* A feature, is a service that delivers value to the end user. 
* Each feature is broken down into a number simpler tasks which are user stories. 

As the user stories were achieved, they were moved from To Do list, to In-Progress, and finally Done lists. You can have a look to the project board [here](https://github.com/users/AlaYousef/projects/4/views/1?layout=board)

## Deployment

The project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). To deploy, please follow these steps:

1. To begin with we need to create a GitHub repository from the [Code Institute template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) by following the link and then click 'Use this template'.


2. Fill in the needed details as stated in the screenshot below and then click 'Create Repository From Template'.

3. When the repository creation is done click 'Gitpod' as stated in the screenshot below.


4. Now it's time to install Django and the supporting libraries that are needed. Type the commands below to do this.

* ```pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn```
* ```pip3 install 'dj_database_url psycopg2```
* ```pip3 install 'dj3-cloudinary-storage```

5. When Django and the libraries are installed we need to create a requirements file.

* ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` - This will create and add required libraries to requirements.txt


6. Now it's time to create the project.

* ```django-admin startproject YOUR_PROJECT_NAME .``` - This will create your project

7. When the project is created we can now create the application.

* ```python3 manage.py startapp APP_NAME``` - This will create your application


8. We now need to add the application to settings.py

8. Now it is time to do our first migration and run the server to test that everything works as expected. This is done by writing the commands below.

* ```python3 manage.py migrate``` - This will migrate the changes
* ```python3 manage.py runserver``` - This runs the server. To test it, click the open browser button that will be visible after the command is run.

9. Now it is time to create our application on Heroku, attach a database, prepare our environment and settings.py file and setup the Cloudinary storage for our static and media files.

* Head on to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in (or create an account if needed).

* In the top right corner there is a button that is labeled 'New'. Click that and then select 'Create new app'.

10. Now it's time to enter an application name that needs to be unique. When you have chosen the name, choose your region and click 'Create app".

11. To add a database to the app you need to go to the resources tab ->> add-ons, search for 'Heroku Postgres' and add it.

12. Go to the settings tab and click on the reveal Config Vars button. Copy the text from DATABASE_URL (because we are going to need it in the next step).

13. Go back to GitPod and create a new env.py in the top level directory. Then add these rows.

* ```import os``` - This imports the os library
* ```os.environ["DATABASE_URL_FROM HEROKU"]``` - This sets the environment variables.
* ```os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]``` - Here you can choose whatever secret key you want.


14. Now we are going to head back to Heroku to add our secret key to config vars. See screenshot below.


15. Now we have some preparations to do connected to our environment and settings.py file. In the settings.py, add the following code:

```import os```

```import dj_database_url```

```if os.path.isfile("env.py"):```

```import env```


16. In the settings file, remove the insecure secret key and replace it with:
```SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')```

17. Now we need to comment out the old database setting in the settings.py file (this is because we are going to use the postgres database instead of the sqlite3 database).


Now, add the link to the DATABASE_URL that we added to the environment file earlier.

18. Save all your fields and migrate the changes.

```python3 manage.py migrate```

19. Now we are going to get our connection to Cloudinary connection working (this is were we will store our static files). First you need to create a Cloudinary account and from the Cloudinary dashboard copy the API Environment Variable.

20. Go back to the env.py file in Gitpod and add the Cloudinary url (it's very important that the url is correct):

```os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://************************"```

21. Let's head back to Heroku and add the Cloudinary url in Config Vars. We also need to add a disable collectstatic variable to get our first deployment to Heroku to work.

22. Let's head back to our settings.py file on Gitpod. We now need to add our Cloudinary Libraries we installed earlier to the installed apps. Here it is important to get the order correct.


23. For Django to be able to understand how to use and where to store static files we need to add some extra rows to the settings.py file.

24. Hang in there, we have just a couple of steps left. Now it's time to link the file to the Heroku templates directory.

25. Let's change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR in the teamplates array.


26. To be able to get the application to work through Heroku we also need to add our Heroku app and localhost to which hosts that are allowed.


27. Now we just need to add some files to Gitpod.

* Create 3 folders in the top level directory: **media**, **static**, **templates**
* Create a file called **Procfile* and add the line ```web: gunicorn PROJ_NAME.wsgi?``` to it.

28. Now you can save all the files and prepare for the first commit and push to Github by writing the lines below.

* ```git add .```
* ```git commit -m "Deployment Commit```
* ```git push```

29. Before moving on to the Heroku deployment we just need to add one more thing in the config vars. We need to add "PORT" in the KEY input field and "8000" in the VALUE field. If we don't add this there might be problems with the deployment.

30. Now it's time for deployment. Scroll to the top of the settings page in Heroku and click the 'Deploy' tab. For deployment method, select 'Github'. Search for the repository name you want to deploy and then click connect.

### How To Fork 

It is possible to do a independent copy of a GitHub Repository by forking the GitHub account. The copy can then be viewed and it is also possible to do changes in the copy without affecting the original repository. To fork the repository, take these steps:

1. After logging in to GitHub, locate the repository. On the top right side of the page there is a 'Fork' button. Click on the button to create a copy of the original repository.

5. To be able to get the project to work you need to install the requirements. This can be done by using the command below:

* ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` - This command downloads and install all required dependencies that is stated in the requirements file.

6. The next step is to set up the environment file so that the project knows what variables that needs to be used for it to work. Environment variables are usually hidden due to sensitive information. It's very important that you don't push the env.py file to Github (this can be secured by adding env.py to the .gitignore-file). The variables that are declared in the env.py file needs to be added to the Heroku config vars which are ```os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]```, ```os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]```, ```os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]``` . Don't forget to do necessary migrations before trying to run the server.

* ```python3 manage.py migrate``` - This will do the necessary migrations.
* ```python3 manage.py runserver``` - If everything i setup correctly the project is now live locally.
